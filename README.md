# Project1
Hello everyone! 
This is a project for EC601. Well, actually this is my first project I have made, and I believe the code and the effect of the program may be not as good as others. I did have a hard time because I have never had similar experiences... So, I will show you how to use it.

Instructions: 

'Tweepy-use.py' and font library 'arial.ttf' should be downloaded to a folder.
Execute 'Tweepy-use' and input the screen name (whose twitter account you want to download images from). 
Then the program would create two folders 'images' and 'video_image'(They are used to store the download images and the images are processed by Google Vision API. ). 
And you can also find a outcome.mp4 which could only be correctly displayed by Windows Media Player, other players may cause a frame lost. 'Tweet.txt' contains all the information about each tweets of the chosen account.

Example: The folder 'project1' contains a example of the program, I download those images from a guy whose name is 'Trump'.

So, please let me know if you face any problem when you use this program especially for TA and professor.
